			Seldom are cloud services and cloud based applications used on their own - there is almost always a need to integrate these new software components with the existing capabilities of the enterprise.  This can involve connecting to existing databases and to existing applications running in-house, typically behind the firewall.  It can involve connecting to existing in-house capabilities such as an ID and Access Management system or System management applications.  Integration may also mean copying key data to the cloud platform for performance reasons, with the necessity of keeping that copy data in sync with the master data in-house.  Integration of this kind is a fundamental part of IBM's offerings.
