        <h2>We draw inspiration from the great work of others</h2>
        <p class="normal">
There are many great examples of Social Business on the web and we draw inspiration from these. Some are mentioned on this page but there are many many more great examples like these.

        <p class="normal">
We want to draw attention to the wide variety of social activities that are already supported so we've not listed some of the more obvious Social Media examples here, but they are valid too, e.g. : Twitter, Facebook, Google, Flick, YouTube etc.
