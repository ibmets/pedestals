By using the Controlled English research from the International Technology Alliance we have been able to demonstrate an environment that can easily federate data from numerous sources: Lotus Notes (email and calendar), ICM Connections (activities), Sametime (instant messages), BluePages (contacts), Twitter, Newsfeeds, browser history, images, publications and others. In addition to this the user can easily create higher level concepts such as people and projects and align these data sources to these concepts enabling a person-wide view of interactions, or a project specific list of relevant items. The Controlled English implementation also enables a human-friendly information format which the end user can make use of to create new knowledge or new models. The ability to define and run rules allows the user to infer new information where appropriate, and the potential for sharing common models and rules is possible and may be investigated in future research.
