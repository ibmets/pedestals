We are all used to dealing with a myriad of electronic information in our lives: email, calendar, contacts, social media, bookmarks, images and other media. We use different tools for each of these and in our heads we carry a model of the real-world things that we really care about: People, events, activities etc.
Can we create an environment that will easily consume this information and allow us to apply it all into the context of these higher level concepts that we actually care about?
