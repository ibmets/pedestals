The Emerging Technology team has been in the area of Social Business for at least a decade. We contributed to the original Social Media Guidelines as part of the crowd-sourcing activity that defined them from active members across IBM. Team members from Emerging Technology also created <a href="http://www.eightbar.co.uk" class="external">eightbar</a> which was (and still is) a public-facing blog about the activities of the team, interesting projects and technology and other Hursley-related items.
