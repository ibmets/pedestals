		<h2>Example: Gamification</h2>
<p class="normal">
Gamification is the application of game-playing mentality in non-game contexts and experimenting with which game mechanics most appeal in different situations. Gamification is more that just badges and points.  A deep understanding of the business problem, the desired behaviour and the user motivations means that a good gamification solution requires design, experimentation, time and effort. The <span class="highlight">Trendification project</span> is a good example of this in action.
