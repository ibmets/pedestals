			We worked with four interns on IBM’s Extreme Blue programme to produce a gamification prototype for the fashion retail brand Very. The concept we developed was perhaps best described as “fantasy football for fashion”. The idea was that Very’s customers could browse the online store and add items to their collection to produce a style they thought would be on trend. Using real time analysis of website hits, sales data and social media sentiment each collection was awarded points to decide how fashionable their collection was.
