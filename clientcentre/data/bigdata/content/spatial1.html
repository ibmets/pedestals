			Hitting archaeological remains is a familiar problem for builders, because the land they are excavating has often been in use for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. At the end of 2014 IBM partnered with STFC and Democrata, a UK data analytics start-up, in a project aimed at help companies guess what's in the ground before they start digging. During the project, we built predictive algorithms, to map where artefacts might still be found in England and Wales, in order to help companies avoid the time and cost of excavation.
