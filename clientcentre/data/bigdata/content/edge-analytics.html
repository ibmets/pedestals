            Efficient processing, federation and aggregation over distributed information in an organisation is a major operational challenge. Gaian is a light-weight ETS data-federation technology which addresses this by accessing and transforming data "at the edge" - in distributed and disparate data sources (structured or unstructured) - and merging results into a "logical table" with a consolidated structure. Gaian nodes can also automatically discover and connect to each other over various network types to form a scalable topology.
