        <h2>EEG Authentication</h2>
        <p>    
            A number of Biometrics modalities have been used very well for authentication in the past. We have done research on EEG Biometrics and applied it to authenticate the users to the system. We have implemented a new algorithm that uses a very low cost sensor, collects limited recording and in a noisy environment performs much better than any other solution that exists in research today. We would be continuing the research in the area of EEG biometrics and investigate the various frequencies in EEG that relates to emotions (very applicable to healthcare sectors) and perform detailed experimentation with them.
