            Today's mobile handheld devices continuously connect to different service providers for day-to-day online activities such as online purchases, online banking, social networking, etc. We must consider quality of communication, usability and the overall end-to-end data security in day-to-day mobile transactions.  When information is being exchanged, it is important to ensure the right levels of access control and privacy.

            Location and identity obfuscation techniques optimally tradeoff security vs. privacy with utility which primarily addresses the 'how to enforce location security problem'. However, this does not address the 'where to enforce location security problem'. We have demonstrated the different places where location security can be enforced and the best solution to fit the purpose.
