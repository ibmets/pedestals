                Performance is key to the viable use of FHE for private computational scenarios. We collaborate with IBM US Research in making performance improvements to FHE via hardware acceleration (FPGAs and GPUs) and using any inherent parallelism in the encryption scheme and algorithm schemes.

                We are also developing a cloud FHE microservices to answer the question, "can we perform computation on encrypted data in the Cloud without having to decrypt it?"
