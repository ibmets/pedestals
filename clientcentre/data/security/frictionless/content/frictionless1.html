        <h2>Our Aim</h2>
        <p>
            Traditional security techniques (e.g. PINs and passcodes) are highly disruptive to the consumer experience. We believe that a superior user experience can be gained without compromising security.
            </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>
            Frictionless ID&amp;V is a pilot project with an innovative, patent-pending, layered approach to mobile authentication. Rather than relying on the user's ability to recall a passcode, this technology gathers information about the user from a variety of sources. A user profile can then be constructed in which useful contextual clues are stored (e.g. current location and network identity). Analysis of this context produces a trust score, albeit the confidence the business has in the authenticity of the user which the business can use to determine the level of access to be granted to the user. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The Benefits</h2>
        <p>
            With Frictionless ID&amp;V, the business retains complete control of risk to ensure compliance with risk profiles across mobile channels. The flexible, context-aware authentication process can be fully managed, resulting in enhanced usability and customer sentiment.
