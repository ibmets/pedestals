            Fully Homomorphic Encrytion (FHE) allows one to outsource computation and keep the inputs and outputs of that computation private even from the person performing the computation. This is acheived by computing on encrypted data that the person computing cannot decrypt.

            This has massive implications on private computation. One such area is genomics where a person's genome has to be kept private, but is required to be able to compare with other genomes.
