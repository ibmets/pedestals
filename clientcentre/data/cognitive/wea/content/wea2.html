            When a question is asked, it is sent to both Hudson and WEA. Each system will provide an answer (or set of answers) along with a score indicating how confident they are in the answer. This confidence score is used to assess which answer to send back to the user.
        </p>

            Hudson maintains the structure of the data through the model which means that as well as returning answers in a structured form of English, they can also be returned as data, e.g. attaching latitude and longitude coordinates as data elements to support rendering on a map.

            Hudson's model of the world is quick and easy to change by adding new concepts and mapping additional data sources and questions on to concepts. This flexibility allows us to rapidly build Hudson's model to answer questions that WEA would struggle with.
