            The challenge of cognitive computing is to emulate the human brain's abilities for perception, action and cognition to deliver large scale, low power computers. The SyNAPSE project has created the True North chip, designed to emulate the neurons and synapses in the human brain, setting aside traditional von Neumann architectures used for the last 70 years.
