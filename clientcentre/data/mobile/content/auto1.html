			Smarter Commute is a mobile app for Android and iOS allowing car drivers using a smart phone to publish their active route to work on the Smarter Commute website.
		</p>
		<p style="padding: 10px;">
			Colleagues can see the route, and the car's location, enabling them to stand in a safe place on the route and request a lift.
		</p>
		<p style="padding: 10px;">
			The driver's smart-phone announces using voice technology that "Jo Smith has requested a lift in 500 meters on Hursley Road" and will display their colleagues image, so they can be recognised.
		</p>
		<p style="padding: 10px;">
			Shared trips are recorded and savings can be viewed on the Smarter Commute website
		</p>
        <p style="padding: 10px;">
			Smarter Commute is built with a Bluemix and Softlayer backend.
