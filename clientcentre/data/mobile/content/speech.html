			The Voice IoT project uses speech to text capabilities to provide a more human friendly interface for controlling home automation solutions, by combining natural language processing and speech recognition it is possible to interpret voice commands and take appropriate actions. Imagine for example being able to simply say "I'm cold" and have the house central heating raise the temperature to warm you up. Or simply state, "I'm going out for an hour" and letting the Voice IoT handle conserving power and heat while you are out.
