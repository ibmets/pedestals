        <h2>VoiceBank</h2>
		<br>
        <p>
			The VoiceBank project addresses the problem of people who have lost their voice through laryngeal cancer, where the voice box is removed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many patients use a prosthesis or an electrolarynx to communicate, which result in the loss of personality in the person's voice. The technology is also expensive for the NHS.
		</p>
		<p>
			VoiceBank allows a pre-op patient to 'bank' their voice by recording a set of sentences.
		</p>
		<p>
			A mobile application with predictive text input is then used post-op to speak using a voice synthesized from the patients recorded samples.

        <h2>WearCare</h2>
        <br>
		<p>
			WearCare is a system to provide a direct medical assistance contact or remote care contact assistant an immediate communication channel to an outpatient. By using a smartwatch to relay sensor data care assistants can be immediately alerted to falls or other key indicator events that occur to individual patients. Patients can communicate through their smart watch using speech to text to request assistance or ask questions.
