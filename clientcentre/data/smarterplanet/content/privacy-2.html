			Emerging Technology is engaged in research that seeks to enable controlled information sharing, whilst
			simultaneously performing a risk assessment on what can be <em>inferred</em> from the information that is shared.
		</p>
		<p style="padding: 7px; line-height: 150%">
			In practice this means obfuscating sensitive information before sharing to protect against a set of
			blacklisted inferences.
		</p>
		<p style="padding: 7px; line-height: 150%">
			In collaboration with our research partners we have built an <em>inference management firewall</em> to provide this
			protection.
