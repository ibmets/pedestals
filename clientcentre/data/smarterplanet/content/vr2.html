			Within Emerging Technology we are using Virtual Reality as a tool to visualise digital designs.
		</p>
		<p style="padding: 10px; line-height: 150%">
			The increasing adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) - digital models of buildings and other
			assets along with rich metadata - supports the planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of an asset.
			The use of Virtual Reality enables a user to explore these models with an ease and flexibility not
			previously available.

		<p style="padding: 10px; line-height: 150%">
			By integrating Virtual Reality technology with the Internet of Things, we can include live telemetry from the real
			world into the virtual one, allowing the user to experience and interact with real world, but geographically
			remote, environments.
