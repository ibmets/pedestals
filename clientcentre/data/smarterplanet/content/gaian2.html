			The Gaian Database is a self-organizing distributed database that gives global access to data from virtually any source
			(including files, spreadsheets, document repositories, Web services, and data feeds as well as other databases).
			Applications can transparently perform database queries across all of these data sources in a single operation,
			revolutionising the way that organisations access and exploit the information held within their IT systems.
