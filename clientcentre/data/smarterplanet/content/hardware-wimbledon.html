			Emerging Technology has the expertise to prototype new capabilities and solutions using these technologies,
			enabling clients to explore their benefits with proof-of-concept projects.
		</p>
		<p style="padding: 10px;">
			For example, Emerging Technology was asked to help prototype technology at Wimbledon to measure light levels
			on court to help with planning for future championships.
			We quickly built a prototype device based on open source commodity hardware.
		</p>
		<p style="padding: 10px;">
			It was important that the sensors were unobtrusive, and so the device was powered using Power over Ethernet
			(PoE) so that only a single cable was needed at each sensor location.
		</p>
		<p style="padding: 10px;">
			The sensor data was plotted on a site map giving an up to the minute view of current playing
			conditions, and also stored in a database for later analysis.
