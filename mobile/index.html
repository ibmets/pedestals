Smarter Commute is a mobile app for Android and iOS allowing car drivers using a smart phone to publish their active route to work on the Smarter Commute website. 
</p>
<p>
Colleagues can see the route, and the car's location, enabling them to stand in a safe place on the route and request a lift. 
</p>
<p>
The driver's smart-phone announces using voice technology that "Jo Smith has requested a lift in 500 meters on Hursley Road" and will display their colleagues image, so they can be recognised. 
</p>
<p>
Shared trips are recorded and savings can be viewed on the Smarter Commute website.

<p>The commoditisation of smartphones has brought about a common set of standard sensor functions and services such as geolocation, motion, audio and visual capture effectively turning devices into mobile sensor hubs.
</p> 
<p>
The reach of the device to other sensors in the vicinity has also been increased with the development of bluetooth low energy capabilities and in some cases Near Field Communication (NFC). 
</p>
<p>
The Emerging Technology team are exploring the possibilities
for a variety of applications including health care, transportation and indoor location.
</p>
</div>

<div class="popover popover8 popoverIL"><div class="cross close"></div><div class="clear"></div>
<p>
The Emerging Technology team are working with Bluetooth LE technology and WiFi device tracking.  
</p> 
<p>
iBeacons are devices that use Bluetooth Low Energy to emit a signal that can be received by a smartphone without pairing with the device. 
</p>
<p>
iBeacon technology can be used for a number of purposes one of which is indoor location, the smartphones position can be triangulated according to the beacons it can see.
</p>
<p>
iBeacons can also be used purely for proximity detection and can trigger a smartphone app to share some data about it's location, for example a customer with a loyalty app on their phone may be standing at a certain display in store and be sent an offer.

<p>
The VoiceBank project addresses the problem of people who have lost their voice through laryngeal cancer, where the voice box is removed.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Many patients use a prosthesis or an electrolarynx to communicate, which result in the loss of personality in the person's voice. The technology is also expensive for the NHS.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
VoiceBank allows a pre-op patient to 'bank' their voice by recording a set of sentences.</p>
<p> A mobile application with predictive text input is then used post-op to speak using a voice 
synthesized from the patients recorded samples.

Major retailers face constantly changing environments, and must consider daily variations in consumer demand, manufacturer promotions or holidays to achieve the right arrangement and assortment of products in the store.  
</p>
<br/>
<p>

The Emerging Technology bridged the gap between IBM Research and Tesco to deploy a visual analytics Mobile App to Manage Product Placement 
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Tesco is testing the IBM solution at a pilot location near London. 
</p>
<p>
<i>“Delivering a better shopping experience to our customers includes making sure products are well stocked and easy to find. The IBM application will help us to improve store operations beyond the current manual processes and barcode-based methods."</i>

<p>
The Emerging technology team has a strong background in messaging and a particular afinity with the MQTT publish subscribe messaging system.</p> 

<p>MQTT provides an extremely flexible way 
of integrating the many sensors and devices together and is a great way of pushing messages securely to mobile devices. 
</p>
<p>
The Universal Information Framework (UIF) uses MQTT messaging to provide a flexible bidirectional messaging platform for connecting back office systems with mobile devices.
</p>
<p>
This secure low power/low bandwidth system is perfect for extending business process flows out to employees in the field.

APIs are playing an increasing part in the expansion of traditional enterprise as information becomes a valuable commodity. 
</p>
<p>
Providing a scalable well structured API will keep you a step ahead of competitors or allow your critical data to reach a range of channels including smartphones.
</p>
<p>
On the device side providing SDKs for the most popular platforms will encourage developer adoption. 
</p>
<p>
The ET team have experience in developing SDKs for iOS and Android platforms.

The development of HTML5 brings with it some exciting features not least the inclusion of media capture function previously absent from the JavaScript specification.
</p>
<p>
The ability to capture video and audio without special plugins has opened up the possiblity for a range of collaboration applications that can be adapted for both desktop and mobile formats using the same codebase. 
</p>
<p>
Using WebRTC we are looking to take advantage of these new capabilities to create unified collaboration systems that can seamlessly connect users both on mobile devices and laptops.
